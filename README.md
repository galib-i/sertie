### [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NE49YmNFNSZpglHOvwFF_7iE3CJ1ZfYy/view)
## Challenge Objective
"The goal is to enhance the frontend of an existing web application with a strong focus on UI/UX improvements, user flow, and interactivity. The overarching business objective is to increase student sign-ups and retention by making the platform more engaging and seamless to use."

### Notes on the Redesign of the UI

#### Registration & Login  
- [x] Simplify the process by requesting minimal information to keep users focused: move "Educational Institution" and "Society" fields to profile customisation instead of the initial sign-up
- [x] Add a name during registration for slight personalisation from the get-go
- [x] Since users already verify registration via email code, expand this to include a one-time link sign-in for existing accounts

#### Pricing  
- [x] Ensure the "Free" plan only displays details relevant to the free tier

#### About Us  
- [x] Add contact details for easy access

#### Resources  
- [x] Focus content specifically on mentorship, renaming it to "Our Mentors" with a limited preview
- [x] Remove the "Career Navigation Guide" content, as it would be better in another place, such as in blog posts, where it can be presented in a more detailed and engaging way, making it feel less like presentation slides

#### Testimonials  
- [x] Integrate reviews throughout the UI to make the experience feel more personal and authentic
