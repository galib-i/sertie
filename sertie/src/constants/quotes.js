    quote: `I spent seven years in management consulting within Financial Services, sepcialising
      in digital transformation, regulation, post-merger integration and Capital Markets innovation.
      Later, I became a Venture Partner at a UAE-based VC fund, focusing on EdTech investments.<br /><br />

      What will surprise most of you is that I did a BA in Politics, International Relations and 
      Philosophy at Royal Holloway, University of London and a MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies 
      at University of Oxford.<br /><br />

      With that in mind, I want to emphasise that you do not have to 'become' what you study. I 
      have seen many students struggling and not being able to land an internship/job because they 
      think they are limited by what they study. In fact, the one thing that really matters I have 
      seen is the ability to talk about what you CAN do (i.e. your skills + competencies) combined 
      with your personal professional brand.<br /><br />

      That is why we built Sertie with the aim to not only help you with that; but also help you 
      to become more competitive and prepared to land an internship/job. With more and more talented 
      students holding a degree, it is key that you stand out from the crowd - and that is what we 
      help you to do.`,

    quote: `I spent the past 7 years in the software space where I, like many graduates, started with 
      little to no experience. I had no idea what my role exactly was and how I was contributing 
      value in my career. Retrospectively, the one thing that allowed me to be with ONE company 
      for more than 7 years was learning and becoming the best in what you do and stay obsessed 
      with it.<br /><br />

      From a customer success manager, managing single corporate accounts, to multiple accounts, 
      building & leading a team all the way to executing strategic product roadmaps and establishing 
      partnership relationships. All of this didn't happen overnight.<br /><br />

      As hard as it is, try to enjoy the journey as much as possible. My journey has been tough, 
      but if you celebrate your own personal wins along the way I am sure every single one of you 
      will achieve big things.<br /><br />

      As your challenges resonate so much with my own personal journey I want to give back, be a 
      mentor myself and contribute to the product that we are building - helping as many students 
      as possible to enhance social mobility.`
