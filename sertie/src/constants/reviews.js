    review: "\"I found the mentor network particularly useful. Having had the opportunity to connect and meet with Adam (a very experienced professional in the financial services industry) was awesome as he invited me to visit the London Stock Exchange for a coffee chat where I got to learn more about my sepcific industry. Overall, I am very pleased with Sertie and highly recommend them to anyone.\"",

    review: "\"Sertie helped tailor my CV for my specific industry and paired me with an experienced professional in consulting. The mentor connect has been the most helpful in terms of discussing what happens on a daily basis in the consulting industry and the corporate lifestyle of a consultant. We also discussed the qualities and skills that top companies look for in interviews.\"",
